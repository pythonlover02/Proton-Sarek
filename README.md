# Proton-For-Old-Vulkan or "Sarek"

Sarek (Proton-For-Old-Vulkan): A custom Proton build with DXVK 1.10.3 for users with GPUs that support Vulkan 1.1+ but not Vulkan 1.3, or for those with non-Vulkan support who want a plug-and-play option featuring personal patches.

**Why does this repository exist?**

Because there are still users with GPUs that support Vulkan 1.1+ but not Vulkan 1.3, as well as others with non-Vulkan support. Those who can use DXVK often rely on older Proton versions, which suffer from lower compatibility and performance compared to newer builds. Meanwhile, users dependent on WineD3D frequently face poor gaming experiences. This repository provides patched versions of Proton and/or Proton-GE, offering better performance with DXVK v1.10.3 and WineD3D mainly trough the custom parameter `PROTON_TWEAKS`, along with other enhancements, ensuring a smoother experience for both Vulkan and non-Vulkan setups.

Please be aware that this is a custom build of Proton and is **not** affiliated with Valve's Proton. If you encounter any issues specific to my Proton build from this repository that do not occur with Valve's version, kindly refrain from submitting a bug report to Valve's bug github. Instead, please report the issue directly on this GitHub. Thank you for your understanding!

## Known Bugs:
Sometimes, when using WineD3D, the maximum supported OpenGL version is capped at 4.4 instead of the expected 4.6. This appears to be a glitch that can be temporarily resolved by following these steps:

1. Start the game using a different Proton version.

2. Once the game is running and rendering properly, close it.

3. Switch back to the desired Sarek Proton build.

4. Open the game, and it should now use the correct OpenGL version.

I’m still investigating a permanent solution to this issue, but this workaround has proven effective in the meantime.

Edit: It should be fixed on versions 9-15-r1 and above thanks to [Artewar67](https://github.com/Artewar67)

## GPU List:
Here its the GPU List of the ones on witch its recommended to use this Proton Build

### NVIDIA:
On NVIDIA cards, it should be all the ones that are stuck on the 470 drivers, previous drivers like 440, 415, 390 and Nouveau users.

### Intel && AMD:
Any GPU or iGPU that is OpenGL only or has a Vulkan API lower than 1.3.

## Parameters:

### Proton:
This are set on the Launch Options of a game on Steam, example:

	PROTON_USE_WINED3D=1 PROTON_NO_ESYNC=1 mesa_glthread=true %command%

The Optimzation variables are set on the same way on the launch options

## Optimization:

### System:
First of all lets start with the must have, Gamemodem, Zram and MangoHud.

| Tool/Library          | Description                                                                                                      | Link                                                 |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `GameMode`               | GameMode is a daemon/lib combo for Linux that allows games to request a set of optimizations to be temporarily applied to the host OS and/or a game process. | [GitHub - GameMode](https://github.com/FeralInteractive/gamemode) |
| `Zram-Generator`       | Zram, formerly called compcache, is a Linux kernel module for creating a compressed block device in RAM.        | [GitHub - Zram-Generator](https://github.com/systemd/zram-generator) |
| `MangoHud`              | MangoHud is a Vulkan and OpenGL overlay for monitoring FPS, temperatures, CPU/GPU load and more.              | [GitHub - MangoHud](https://github.com/flightlessmango/MangoHud) |

My personal recomendation its to search a tutorial for the installation of the three in your favorite Linux Distro *;P*

### Sarek:
These are the custom parameters introduced in Sarek to enhance performance and provide fallback rendering options.

| Environment Variable              | Description                                                                                                          |
|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `PROTON_TWEAKS=[0/1]`             | Enables all the `PROTON_TWEAKS_*` parameters for general performance optimization                                    |
| `PROTON_TWEAKS_PROTON=[0/1]`      | Adds a set of Proton/Wine optimizations as environment variables                                                     |
| `PROTON_TWEAKS_NVIDIA=[0/1]`      | Adds a set of optimizations for NVIDIA proprietary drivers                                                           |
| `PROTON_TWEAKS_MESA=[0/1]`        | Adds a set of optimizations for MESA drivers                                                                         |
| `PROTON_VK_SOFTWARE=[0/1]`        | Uses Lavapipe for CPU-based rendering for Vulkan, supporting API version 1.3, PROTON_TWEAKS comes enabled by default |
| `PROTON_OGL_SOFTWARE=[0/1]`       | Uses LLVMpipe for CPU-based rendering for OpenGL, supporting API version 4.6, PROTON_TWEAKS comes enabled by default |

**Below are benchmarks comparing performance with** `PROTON_TWEAKS` **enabled and disabled:** 
- [AMD Benchmark](https://flightlessmango.com/games/38020/logs/5865)
- [NVIDIA Benchmark](https://flightlessmango.com/games/38020/logs/5863) (using proprietary drivers)

**Requirements for Using Lavapipe (Vulkan Software Rendering):**
- **Mesa Version**: 20.3 or newer
- **CPU**: Multi-core recommended for better performance

**Requirements for Using LLVMpipe (OpenGL Software Rendering):**
- **Mesa Version**: Any recent version (LLVMpipe is well-supported in current Mesa releases)
- **CPU**: Multi-core recommended for better performance

### Additional Tips:

1. If that of a above its not enought, you might want to check newer kernel versions or patched/customiced kernels(zen, liquorix, xanmod, cachyoskernel, clearkernel, etc), i personally recomend the vanilla kernel tought

2. You might want to use the drop shader cache command of the linux kernel before playing a game, you should do:

   ```
   sudo su
   echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches
   exit
   ```

3. You might want to use Mangohud to cap your fps and set the fps cap mode, this its an example:

   ```
   MANGOHUD_CONFIG=fps_limit=60,fps_limit_method=early,no_display mangohud %command%
   ```

   What does this do? `MANGOHUD_CONFIG=parameters,parameters` overwrites the current MangoHud config. Another option is to add the following to the MangoHud config file:

   ```
   fps_limit=60
   fps_limit_method=early
   no_display
   ```

   Also, remember that for MangoHud to work with OpenGL games, you should use `mangohud --dlsym` instead of just `mangohud` in the Steam Launch Parameters.

   You can remove the `no_display` option (which hides the MangoHud HUD), change the `fps_limit` value to any number you like, and change the `fps_limit_method` to `early` (for smoother frametimes) or `late` (for the lowest latency).

   Check out the [MangoHud GitHub repository](https://github.com/flightlessmango/MangoHud) for more information and configuration options.

## Building:

Follow these steps to add to your Proton Build the Sarek patches:

### 1. Download/Compile Proton
- **Option 1:** Compile your Proton build from source.

- **Option 2:** Download a precompiled Proton build (GE-Proton or Valve's stable release are the only ones officially supported).

### 2. Get the Sarek Patches
- Clone or download the Sarek-Patches dir from this repository.

### 3. Rename the Proton Executable (if necessary)
- If you're using **GE-Proton**, no need to rename anything, as the default `proton` file works out of the box.
- For **Valve's Proton** builds:
  - Rename `proton` (from the Sarek-Patches dir) to something else like `proton-ge`.
  - Rename the `proton-valve` file from the Sarek-Patches to `proton`.

### 4. Modify Compatibilitytool.vdf and Proton Files
- Edit both `compatibilitytool.vdf` and `proton` files to reflect the name of your build (replace "Sarek" with your custom build name).

- Optionally, make additional tweaks to `wine.inf` or other configuration files as needed for your specific build.

### 5. Make the `make.sh` Script Executable
- If you want a build with normal DXVK or DXVK-Async, make the appropriate script executable:

		chmod +x /path/to/make.sh       # For normal DXVK
		chmod +x /path/to/make-async.sh  # For DXVK-Async

### 6. Run the Build Script

- Execute the script with superuser privileges:

		sudo /path/to/make.sh

- or for the async build:

		sudo /path/to/make-async.sh

When prompted, provide the path to the Proton build you downloaded or compiled.

### 7. Enjoy Your Custom Proton Build!

- Thats all, enjoy *:)*

## Credits:
This project also uses many 3rd party code and patches, i just do little patches so everything works well with an older DXVK, go support them, they are the ones that do the heavy work

### Valve:
https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton && https://github.com/ValveSoftware/wine

First of all, we extend our sincere thanks to Valve for their incredible contributions to the Linux gaming community through the creation of Proton, which has made gaming on Linux more accessible and enjoyable for everyone. As such, we sometimes use Valve's Proton builds as a base for our internal or public releases, or for comparison with those based on Proton-GE. Additionally, much of the code in the wine.inf file is directly sourced from Valve's Proton and Wine.

### GloriousEggroll:
